I graduated with my bachelor's in Information Technology while working full time and growing my experience across the Retail and Banking/Financial Services industries. 

Currently, I work driving solutions related to risk and operational challenges.

In my free time I enjoy traveling and learning about new things such as setting up this website or tinkering with my raspberry pi.
