This is a personal github-pages website using ([Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)) based on ([Jekyll Now]([https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)))

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs 

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.
